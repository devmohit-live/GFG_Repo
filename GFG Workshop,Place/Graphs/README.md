# Graphs

## Concepts:

1. Implementation

   1. [x] Adjancy List of Integer
   2. [x] Adjancy list of Edges

2. [x] BFS & Connected Components(for Undirected)
3. [x] DFS & Connected Components(for Undirected)
4. Topological Sort:
   1. [x] Using DFS (Stack)
   2. [x] Using BFS (Kahn's Algo)(indegree of vertices)
5. Cycle Detection:
   1. Undirected:
      1. [x] Using DFS
      2. [ ] Using BFS
      3. [ ] Using Disjoint Set
   2. Directed:
      1. [x] Using DFS
      2. [x] Using BFS (Kahn's Algo Modified)
6. Shorest Path
   1. [ ] Shotest Path in Undirected(in terms of Edges)
   2. [ ] Shotest Path in Undirected(in terms of Weight)
   3. [x] Shotest Path in DAG
7. MST:
   1. [x] Prims
   2. [x] Kruskal
8. Single Sourse Shotest Path:
   1. [x] Dijkstras
   2. [x] Bellman Ford
9. Strongly Connected Components
   1. [ ] Articulation Point/Cut Vertces (Undirected)
   2. [ ] Bridges in Graph (for Undirected Graph)
   3. [x] Kosaraju's Algo (Directed)
   4. [ ] Tarjan's Algo (Directed Graph With/without Cross Edges)
